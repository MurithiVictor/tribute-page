        <p>Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist. He is widely considered
            to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>

        <p>Born on June 23, 1912, Turing made significant contributions during World War II by helping to crack
            German codes, including the Enigma machine, at Bletchley Park. His work laid the foundation for modern
            computing and had a profound impact on the field.</p>

        <p>Tragically, Turing's life was cut short, and he passed away on June 7, 1954. Despite the challenges he
            faced, his legacy endures, and he is remembered as a pioneer in the world of computing.</p>
